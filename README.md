# Attendance System

## Overview  
This document outlines the progress and implementation details of the Attendance System project, specifically reflecting the completion of **Task 3**. This task focused on enabling accurate attendance tracking, data validation, and report generation for both individual students and entire classes.

## ✅ Task 3: What Was Required and How It's Now Met

| Requirement | Completed | Explanation |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **User Roles (student/admin)** | ✅ | Basic login system using a simulated in-memory structure with roles. |
| **Attendance Status Enforcement** | ✅ | Accepted statuses (`present`, `absent`, `tardy`) are enforced via a defined Enum. |
| **Record Attendance (Single & Bulk)** | ✅ | Students can self-mark; admins can mark attendance in bulk for classes. |
| **Avoid Duplicates** | ✅ | System checks for existing records before inserting new ones. |
| **Reports & Summaries** | ✅ | Functions return summaries by student and subject, including attendance rates. |
| **Filtered Lists** | ✅ | Can retrieve attendance records filtered by status, subject, and date range. |
| **Model Relationships** | ✅ | Bidirectional SQLAlchemy relationship between `Student` and `Attendance` models implemented. |

## Features Completed

- **Attendance Recording**
  - Single attendance (per student) with validation.
  - Bulk attendance (per class) with duplicate checking.
- **Status Handling**
  - Centralized enum to define accepted statuses.
  - Consistent enforcement across all logic layers.
- **Reporting System**
  - Attendance summaries for a student between date ranges.
  - Class-level attendance rate percentage.
  - Filterable list for absent/tardy records.
- **Data Modeling**
  - Proper use of SQLAlchemy relationships between students and their attendance records.
- **Error Handling**
  - Database rollback and custom error messages for all failure scenarios.

## What Still Needs Work (Future Tasks)

1. **Replace In-Memory Login**
   - Move to a database-driven authentication system.
   - Implement hashed passwords, role-based access, and session management.

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Currently back-end focused. A frontend UI should be built or connected.

3. **Access Controls**
   - Restrict which users can view or modify which data (based on role).

4. **Data Validation and UX Improvements**
   - Add client-side form validation.
   - Display cleaner messages in the frontend on success or failure.

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for attendance services and reporting logic.
   - Integration testing for routes once a UI or API is added.
